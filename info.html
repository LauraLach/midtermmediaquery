          <h2>What is ASL?</h2>
          <p>American Sign Language, or ASL, is a visual language used primarily by Deaf and hard-of-hearing people. The way the language is 'spoken' is by using various hand gestures, known as signs, and facial expressions. It can also be 'spoken' via fingerspelling, which is when a word is signed letter-by-letter. However, this is typically only done when a word does not have its own sign.</p><br><p>One major thing to note about ASL is it is NOT English in sign form - it is its own language with its own words, grammar, and structure. Some Deaf people's first language is ASL, not English. In addition, other English-speaking countries have their own sign languages. For example, the United Kingdom has British Sign Language, which is very different from ASL.</p>

          <h2>Facial Expressions</h2>
          <p>Facial expressions are vital to American Sign Language for many reasons. One reason is that it can be confusing if, for example, someone were to sign "angry" but were smiling. Another reason is that a sign can have a different depending on the facial expression. For example, if someone told a joke and signed "funny," their facial expression would indicate how funny they thought the joke was. If their face was fairly neutral, it would indicate that the joke was not very funny, but if their face was very expressive, it would indicate that the joke was hilarious.</p>

          <h2>Deaf vs deaf</h2>
          <p>Deaf with an uppercase 'D' and deaf with a lowercase 'd' have two different meanings. Generally, deaf refers to the audiological condition of not hearing, while Deaf refers to a group of deaf people who share a culture. This distinction exists because some deaf people choose to not be part of the Deaf community nor culturally identify as Deaf. This can occur if a person becomes deaf later in life or if someone does not have the resources to participate in Deaf culture.</p>

          <h2>Deaf Culture</h2>
          <p>Many deaf people are part of a rich Deaf culture. This culture includes its own primary language (sign language), history, traditions, values, educational institutions, sports, art, movies, literaure, and more. People of this culture like being deaf and greatly celebrate their culture.</p>
