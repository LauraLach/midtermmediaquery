        <p>In the early 1700s, there was one place that was famous for its sign language use: Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The island had a large Deaf population; therefore, sign language was very common. Everyone used it, including hearing people. The sign language used was called Martha's Vineyard Sign Language, or MVSL, which is categoried as a village sign language.</p>

        <p>The American School for the Deaf was founded on April 15th, 1817 by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, Laurent Clerc, and Mason Cogswell. Here, many students were fluent in MVSL or a different village sign language, and some students knew home signs, which are signs that are typically only used within a single household. In addition, Clerc taught the students French Sign Language. From village sign languages, home signs, and French Sign Language, American Sign Language was created.</p>
